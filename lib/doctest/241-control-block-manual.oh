# KEYWORD: manual
# PROVIDE: block
# REQUIRE: control

## #### Block
##
## The most basic control structure in oh is the block. A block creates a new
## scope and evaluates to the value returned by the final command in the block.
##
## The command,
##
#{
block {
    define x = 1
}
set x = 3
#}
##
## produces the output,
##
#+     oh: error/runtime: 'x' undefined
##
## as the variable x is not accessible outside the scope in which it was
## defined.
##
## Variable are created with the `define` command. A variable's value can be
## changed with the `set` (or, in the same scope, `define`) command.
