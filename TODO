- Number operations: even, odd, [remainder (?),] max, min, abs, floor, ceiling,
  gcd, lcm, truncate, round, expt, sqrt [, exp, log, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos,
  atan]
- Parameter substitution (for environment variables)
- Detection and formatting/parsing of recursive structures
- Signal handing:
  - 'trap' builtin (trap <signal1> [... <signalN>] <method>)
- Go FFI (for modules that are really Go->shell wrappers)
- If we push nil before head is evaluated can '@' work as first element?
- Can executable size / memory use be reduced?
- Improve error checking and error messages.
