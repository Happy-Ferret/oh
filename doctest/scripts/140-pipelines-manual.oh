## ### Pipelines and Filters
##
## The standard output of one command may be connected to the standard input
## of another command using the pipe operator.
##
#{
ls | wc -l
#}
##
## The commands connected in this way constitute a pipeline. The overall
## effect is the same as,
##
#{
ls >file; wc -l file
#}
##
## except that no file is used. Instead the two processes are connected by a
## pipe and are run in parallel.
##
## A filter is a command that reads its standard input, transforms it in some
## way, and sends the result to standard output. One such filter `grep` selects
## from its input those lines that contain some specified string.
##
#{
ls | grep old
#}
##
## A pipeline may consist of more than two commands.
##
#{
ls | grep old | wc -l
#}
