# BEFORE: intro
# KEYWORD: readme
# PROVIDE: note

## Note:
## -----
## 
## Unless you are tracking the default (development) branch of Go, you will
## need to apply a small patch before building Oh. This patch only works on
## BSD or Linux. To apply the patch copy exec_bsd.go.patched or
## exec_linux.go.patched, as appropriate, over the existing file in your Go
## source tree and run all.bash to re-complile Go.
## 
## Alternatively, remove your OS from the list of build constraints in the
## files unix.go and other.go to build oh with job control disabled.
